A multi-user web application for managing supermarkets using Java, Javascript and Jquery.

Users who are "store owners" can define the information about their store, discounts and products in an XML file, upload it to the site and thus make it accessible to potential customers.<br>
Users who are consumers can make an order from these stores, while the system performs the ideal price comparison according to consumer requirements.
